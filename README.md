# Day 2 Project: Tip Calculator

This is a simple **Tip Calculator** built in Python. It helps you calculate how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including the tip.

## How It Works

1. The program asks for the **total bill** amount.  
2. You enter the **tip percentage** you want to give (10%, 12%, or 15%).  
3. You enter the **number of people** sharing the bill.  
4. The program calculates the **total amount including tip** and splits it equally among the people.  
5. It prints out **how much each person should pay**.
